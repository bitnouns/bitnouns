## bitNouns

First there were NounsDAO.

Then there were Lil Nouns.

Next came bitNouns.

An expansion DAO based on Lil Nouns DAO, bitNouns works to create another layer within the Nounish ecosystem; The teeniest tiniest Noun yet.

By expanding the ecosystem, bitNouns aims at exposing more people to Lil Nouns, and in turn Nouns DAO/the entire Nounish ecosystem via a practically free way to participate.

Although bitNouns have been set up with an auction, the reserve is set for the lowest possible fee + gas fees while using Nouns.Build to:

A. Give new web3 participants a low barier of entry into NFTs.
B. Give people a chance to enter into the Nouns Ecosystem and experience Nounish governance for as low cost as possible. 

bitNoun auctions begin on April 1st 2023 with a .0001 eth reserve + Gas fees.

Each bitNoun will represent 1 vote on Lil Nouns DAO Proposals through bitNoun delegations **only.**

bitNouns will start with 1 Lil Nouns delegated from the bitNounders and creators of www.Nouns101.wtf.

bitNouns will also accept delegation of Lil Nouns and NounsDAO tokens to further experiment with a nearly-free governance model in the Nouns Ecossystem.

**Disclaimer: bitNouns is an experiment and intended for educational purposes only.**
