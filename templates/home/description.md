# WTF is bitNouns?

First there was [NounsDAO](https://nouns.wtf/).

Then there was [Lil Nouns](https://lilnouns.wtf/).

**Next comes bitNouns.**

bitNouns was formed to give new web3 participants a way to learn about web3, DAOs, and experience Nounish DAO governance while traversing the Nouns101.wtf educational platform.

bitNouns allow token holders to participate in Lil Nouns DAO governance at a *practically free cost of entry.

bitNouns was started with 1 Lil Noun delegated to them by the bitNounders (founders) and creators of Nouns101.wtf. The number of tokens delegated to bitNouns may grow over time.

**Disclaimer:** bitNounsDAO is for educational purposes related to [Nouns101.wtf only](https://www.nouns101.wtf/).
