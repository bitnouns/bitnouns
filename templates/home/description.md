# WTF is bitNouns?

bitNouns were formed to give new web3 participants a way to learn about web3, DAOs, and experience Nounish DAO governance while traversing the Nouns101.wtf educational platform.

bitNouns allow token holders to participate in Lil Nouns DAO governance at a practically free cost of entry.

bitNouns was started with just 1 Lil Noun delegated to them by the bitNounders / creators of Nouns101.wtf. The number of tokens delegated to bitNouns may grow over time.
