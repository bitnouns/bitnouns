title: A free* Nounish Governance Token
order: 0
---

- bitNouns were formed to give new web3 participants a way to learn about web3, DAOs, and experience Nounish DAO governance while traversing the Nouns101.wtf educational platform.

- bitNouns allow token holders to participate in Lil Nouns DAO governance at a *practically free cost of entry.*

- bitNouns was started with just 1 Lil Noun delegated to them by the bitNounders / creators of Nouns101.wtf. The number of tokens delegated to bitNouns may grow over time.

- bitNoun token holders will use their votes to vote on Lil Nouns DAO Proposals, which can be found here: https://lilnouns.wtf/vote.

**Where can you participate with your bitNouns?**

bitNouns make their home in the Lil Nouns DAO Discord Server. To get started, join the server here: https://discord.gg/lilnouns

*- More on how to verify for a bitNouner Role and to vote, coming soon.*

**"Practically Free"** 

Our hope was to give an completely free governance token to allow new users to experience Nounish DAO governance with zero cost. Because we chose to use the Nouns.Build tool (for a number of reasons) we were forced to set the auction reserve to .0001 eth (or about $0.20 usd cents). 

In addition, there will be a small eth gas transaction fee.

Our hope is that new users can mint bitNouns for as close to the .0001 eth reserve fee as possible, and we suggest waiting for the next auction (running in 5 minute intervals) if there are others bidding.
